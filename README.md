A State-of-the-Art Large-scale Pretrained Response generation model (DialoGPT)
DialoGPT is a SOTA large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations. 
The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test. 
The model is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread.

DialoGPT was proposed in DialoGPT: Large-Scale Generative Pre-training for Conversational Response Generation by Yizhe Zhang, Siqi Sun, Michel Galley, Yen-Chun Chen, Chris Brockett, Xiang Gao, Jianfeng Gao, Jingjing Liu, Bill Dolan. Itâ€™s a GPT2 Model trained on 147M conversation-like exchanges extracted from Reddit.
